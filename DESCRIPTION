Description: Functions and data sets for simulating and fitting minification and random coefficient minification time series models. The nth term in the model X[n] is a nonnegative random variable defined as A[n]*min(X[n-1], Y[n]), where the A's and Y's are sequences of independent random variables.  Example data sets are provided where this kind of model can be justified on physical grounds and fits well.  Functions for simulating minification time series and for maximum  likelihood estimation are included. More information can be found in Han, Braun and Loeppky (2018) <doi:10.1007/s00362-018-1000-6>.
